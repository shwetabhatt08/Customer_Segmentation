# Customer_Segmentation
In this project, we will analyze a dataset that describes the customer order summary of a Food Delivery business. One of the objectives of this project is to decsribe the variations in the different types of customers that use the app and hence segment the customers into useful categories. Doing so would help the Food Delivery Service structure their services and business strategies(personalization) by making use of the relevant insights.
